    <P>Below is a list of ingredients that are used in cooking Mantu</P>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups ground beef or lamb</li>
        <li>2/3 cup onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 package of egg roll or wonton wraps</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat pan over medium heat and add the garlic, ground beef, coriander, and some salt. Cook until the meat is halfway cooked for about 15 to 20 minutes. Add a few dashes of black pepper to taste and then remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Mix in the cup of raw chopped onions with the meat and let it cool down to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Cut egg roll wraps into 4-inch diameter circles or squares. Place approximately one tablespoon of the cooled ground meat and onion mixture onto each wrap. To make the wraps stick together easily, wet the edges with water (you may use your fingers or a basting brush). Fold over the first two opposite ends of the egg roll wrap, followed by the other two ends to enclose the dumplings. Press the edges tightly to seal together. Continue doing this with the remaining wraps.</li>
        <li>Take the racks out of the steamer dish. Add water to the dish, cover, and bring to a boil. Grease the bottom of the steamer racks with oil to prevent sticking and place the dumplings on top, leaving some room in between each dumpling so they don't stick together. Once the water has come to a boil, place the racks filled with dumplings back on to the steamer dish. Cover lid and steam for approximately 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the dumplings are steaming, prepare the vegetable sauce mixture.</li>
    </ol>
